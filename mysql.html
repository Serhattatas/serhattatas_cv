        <p>The diagrams represent a Library Management System, showcasing how books, authors, customers, and borrowing processes are managed. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the database structure, where entities like Book, Author, Category, Customer, and Borrow Book are connected through relationships such as "borrows" and "has." Each book belongs to a category and can have multiple authors, while customers can borrow multiple books.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Class Diagram translates this into an object-oriented model, defining classes with attributes (e.g., title, ISBN, borrow_date) and methods like add(), remove(), and search(). It highlights customer-book interactions and book categorization within the system. Overall, the diagrams ensure seamless integration between database management and functional system design for a library.</p>
